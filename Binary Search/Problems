Basic pattern	

54.	Search in a sorted array(Efficiently -> So learn binary search for this)
55.	Find floor and ceil in sorted array
56.	Find first and last occurence of element in sorted array
57.	Find missing num from 1 to N
58.	Find square root
59.	Search for element in infinite array

Sorted rotated array	

60.	Search element in sorted rotated array(With and without duplicate)
61.	Minimum element in sorted rotated array(With and without duplicate)
63.	Number of times array is sorted
64.	Maximum element in sorted rotated array

Biotonic array	

65.	Find the peak element
66.	Search element in biotonic array

Matrix	

67.	Find row with maximum number of 1's
68.	Search in row wise column wise sorted matrix
69.	Search in sorted matrix II
70.	Find peak in sorted matrix

Application(Super imp)
